# Installation

**Locally:**

- Install jekyll: https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/ubuntu/

**Using docker:**

We first need to install the dependencies; mainly `docker-compose` and stuff from `jekyll`:

```bash
./setup_dev.env
```
# Run website

Modify the files from the source; and run: `docker-compose up`

The web server will start and you will be able to access to the website in:
